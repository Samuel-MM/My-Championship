# My Championship

This is a small project that aims to simulate soccer matches. It generates random match results, allowing each team to have a variable goal difference between 0 and 10. The winner of each match progresses to the next stage.

If there is a draw, the criterion adopted, due to deadlines, was for the visiting team to continue.

## Execution

 - First, run: ``` php artisan migrate ``` to execute all migrations;
 - Then, run: ``` php artisan serve ``` to start your server. It should run at: https://localhost:8000;
 - Open another terminal and run: ``` npm run dev ``` to make sure everything will be working well and you'll be able to change everything.
